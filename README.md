# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcus

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer with a strong focus on relational databases, SQL programming, system design. I thrive on building efficient data structures, optimizing queries, and designing solutions that solve real-world problems. 
## 🧠 What I Do Best

- 💾 **SQL Mastery** – writing complex queries, managing tables, and performing relational operations like joins, projections, and selections  
- 🏗️ **Database Design** – creating schemas, applying normalization principles, and modeling business processes  
- 🔍 **Data Integrity & Validation** – implementing logic to ensure consistent, reliable data across systems  
- 🔧 **System Integration** – connecting SQL with Java and other languages for practical applications  

## 📚 Learning Goals

I'm currently diving deeper into:
- Connecting SQL to larger software architectures
- Exploring advanced normalization and performance optimization
- Integrating databases into scalable, maintainable backend systems
